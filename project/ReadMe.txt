In the source code folder, there will be a Printtokens.java file, PrinttokenTest.java file, and some other text file with inputs. Include these files in your java IDE and run it with those files.

Alternatively, go to your computer terminal. 'cd' into the directory that has the java file. For example: cd Source_code, cd src, cd Printtokens

Once you have reached the directory with the java files, type out the following commands. 
	javac Printtokens.java
	java Printtokens.java
And then enter the input values.

To run the PrinttokensTest.java file, run it in the java IDE you are using such as Eclipse.
